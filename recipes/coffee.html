<h1>Starbucks Caramel Frappuccino Copycat Recipe</h1>
<img src="coffee.jpg">
<p>This is my version of Starbucks Caramel Frappuccino! It's easy to make at home by blending coffee with milk, caramel sauce, and ice. Top each glass with whipped cream and drizzle more caramel sauce on top. Serve with a straw.

</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups ice</li>
    <p>Ice is the base of this caramel Frappuccino recipe. Crushed ice is best (and more blender-friendly), but cubed ice will work too. </p>
    <li>1 cup strongly brewed black coffee, cooled
    </li>
    <p>Make sure the coffee is strong so it's not overpowered by the other ingredients. Also, it's important to ensure the coffee is completely cooled so it doesn't melt the ice. </p>
    <li>1 cup low-fat milk</li>
    <p>Low-fat milk, when combined with ice, creates an irresistible texture that's the perfect blend of creamy and icy. </p>
    <li>⅓ cup caramel sauce</li>
    <p>If you want to get fancy, drizzle the caramel sauce on the inside of the glass before you pour in the Frappuccino. </p>
    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <p>Sweeten things up a bit with white sugar. This recipe, which makes two drinks, calls for three tablespoons – but you can adjust the sugar to suit your taste. </p>
</ul>
